.SH NAME
comedi2py \- Realtime data plotting and processing with python
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B comedi2py
[\fIOPTION\fR]... MODULE
.SH DESCRIPTION
comedi2py feeds data at a specified sampling rate
from a COMEDI data-acquisition device
into python by using call-back functions. The goal
is to make this as easy as possible
hiding all the complexity of COMEDI in comedi2py and 
providing the python program with just
an array of the sampled data at the given sampling rate.
.P
There are three callback functions for the python MODULE which
need to be implemented:
.br
.B comedistart(samplingrate,minRange,maxRange) 
is called once comedi2py
has been started. The samplingrate is the rate the callback
function comedidata() is called and minRange and maxRange
are the minimum and maximum values of the COMEDI device(s).
.br
.B comedidata(card1,card2,card3,...) 
is called periodically at the given sampling rate where every variable
card1,...,cardn contains all samples from the corresponding
COMEDI device as a stanard python list.
.br
.B comedistop() 
is called when comedi2py is closed.
.SH PARAMETERS
All parameters are stored in a configuration file which is
MODULE specific so that different modules can have different
settings. All settings can be overridden by the
command line parameters and are then saved in the configuration
file ~/.config/USB-DUX/comedi2py.ini.
.TP
\-c CHANNELS
sets the number of channels
.TP
\-d DEVICES
sets the maximum number of comedi devices (default is the all
connected COMEDI devices are used)
.TP
\-r SAMPLINGRATE_DAQ
sets the sampling rate of the DAQ card which
.TP
\-s SAMPLINGRATE_PYTHON
sets the sampling rate of the python callback 
(SAMPLINGRATE_PYTHON < SAMPLINGRATE_DAQ)
